A tiny lil' side project I'm working on that focuses on bringing a handy Steam games library to the Terminal!
It's effectively a TUI based Steam library ~

In the future, there's a possibility I might fork certain functionality of this program and create more projects out of it!
This would most likely include the basic graphics library/engine/idk wtf to call this, that I use to draw basic ascii boxes out of provided characters

Also, I have a little module, that I made, that outputs all app names, **with their IDs**, that you have installed, to a handy JSON file, which might also be a neat little fork in the future, for anyone interested!

***No more shitty and unintuitive UIs made purely in CSS***
